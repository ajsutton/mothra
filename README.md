# Mothra: The Thing That Should Not Be

Mothra was created to house native language bindings between [Rust-LibP2P](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) and any number of other languages.
The current languages that are supported are:

- C (in progress)
- Java (in progress)
  
It is also designed to provide a simple API that requires no previous knowledge of libP2P.  The API shouldn't be anymore complicated 
than:

- basic network configuration settings (e.g. ip addresses, ports, logging, etc)
- RPC/PubSub
  - method invocation
  - event subscription
  - ingress
  - egress

> Note: Mothra is early in development and NOT production ready.
