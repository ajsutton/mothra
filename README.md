# Mothra: The Thing That Should Not Be

> Credits: This project borrows heavily from: https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse

Mothra was created to house native language bindings between [Rust-LibP2P](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) and any number of other languages.
The current languages that are supported are:

- C (in progress)
- Java (in progress)
  
It is also designed to provide a simple API that requires no previous knowledge of libP2P.  The API shouldn't be anymore complicated 
than:

- basic network configuration settings (e.g. ip addresses, ports, logging, etc)
- RPC/PubSub
  - method invocation
  - event subscription
  - ingress
  - egress

> Note: Mothra is early in development and NOT production ready.

### Prereqs

On OSX:

Install rustup so you can switch between Rust versions:

```sh

> brew install rustup

```

Install the Rust compiler and package manager:

```sh

> rustup-init

```

`tmux` is the last prereq, but it is optional.  Installing it will make running the demo easier:

```sh

> brew install tmux

```


### Build Mothra

Building is easy.  First, clone the repo:

```sh

> git clone git@github.com:jrhea/mothra.git

```

Next cd into the project's root dir and build:

```sh

> make all

```

### Run sample app

The sample app demonstrates two clients using Disv5 to find each other and the use of GossipSub to send messages back and forth.

If you have `tmux` installed, it is a little simpler to run:

```sh

> cd examples/c && sh peerDemo.sh

```

If you don't have `tmux` installed and don't want to, then as long as you have followed all the instructions above, then it should work.  

In one terminal run:

```sh

> ./bin/mothra

```

In a second terminal run:

```sh

> ./mothra --boot-nodes -IW4QKaKpM5ljLpEEuFjcmoqFVYpY2PVGigNX3vFWzJzfjESWmltcztnrgKP8hLHKShBZTd2lIfjpwCiZCtK8GjPQq4DgmlwhH8AAAGDdGNwgiMog3VkcIIjKIlzZWNwMjU2azGhA7mA0yD2yMhLDZ2cHtQCe-2xhLrBmcCM2Eg9jYWDFqk5 --listen-address 127.0.0.1 --port 9001 --datadir /tmp/.artemis

```
